Due Tuesday March 31st at 11:59PM via Github (link will be provided)

Using the Nencounter table from the class data:
a) How many patients had at least 1 inpatient encounter that started in 2003?

	Answer:
 	 - inpt flags any inpatient encounter and inptcount counts the number of inpatient encounter 
 	 - 1074 patients had at least 1 inpatient enounter that started in 2003;

	                                     

                                      Inpatient encounter flag

b) How many patients had at least 1 emergency room encounter that started in 2003? 

	Answer:
 	 - 1978 patients had at least 1 emergency encounter that started in 2003



                       Flag for at least 1 emergency room encounter

c) How many patients had at least 1 visit of either type (inpatient or emergency room encounter) that started in 2003?

	Answer:
 	 - 2891 patients had at least 1 visit of either inpatient or emergency room encoutner that started in 2003. 

d) In patients from c) who had at least 1 visit of either type, create a variable that counts the total number encounters (of either type)-for example, 
a patient with one inpatient encounter and one emergency room encounter would have a total encounter count of 2.

 Generate a frequency table of total encounter number for this data set, and paste the (text) table into your assignment- 
use the SAS tip from class to make the table output text-friendly

	Answer: 
	 - 2891 patients had at least 1 encounter of either type, and enccount variable counts the number of any encounter. Below is the frequency table of the total encounter number

                         number of any encounter (either inpt or ER)

ie: 
options formchar="|----|+|---+=|-/\<>*"; 

Additional Info/hints
-you only need to use the NENCOUNTER table for this question 
-EncWID uniquely identifies encounters
-EncPatWID uniquely identifies patients
-Use EncStartDtm to identify encounters occurring in 2003
-EncVisitTypeCd identifies encounter types (EMERG/INPT)

-You will need to flatfile to end up 1 row per patient id, and decide on a strategy to count inpatient, emerg and total encounters 
for each patient to answer each part of the assignment. 
-There are many ways to accomplish these tasks. You could create one final dataset that can be used to answer all of a) through d), 
or you may wish to create different datasets/use different approaches to answer different parts. 
Choose an approach you are most comfortable with, and include lots of comments with your SAS code to 
describe what your code is doing (makes part marks easier to award and a good practice regardless).

Please submit your solutions through Github as a plain text .sas or .txt file.
